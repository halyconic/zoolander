</head>

<body>
	<p>
	This part provides an advanced search capability. That is, one should be able
	to search for books using a combination of attributes, such as title and price, 
	or title and quantity, etc.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	We do not provide a sample implementation 
	for this part, in the book domain. You will have to implement such an advanced
	search capability for your project domain.
